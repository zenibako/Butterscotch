<!--
Introduction: one short paragraph, then the game-data notice.
- What is this, in one sentence? (Whose runner is it a port of, and to what device?)
- Which game and version does it run today?
- What is this repository in relation to Butterscotch, and where does the port live in it?
  (A fork, on the `pocket` branch; src/openfpga/ is the port and src/openfpga/dist/ the core definition.
  The openfpgaOS SDK is a separate checkout the build reads.)
- Upstream lists out-of-tree ports under "Community Ports" in its README; the two there open with a
  short note about the port and then carry the original README below. This file follows that shape.
- The notice a reader must not miss: no game data is included; what do they have to supply?
-->

This is a port of Butterscotch for the Analogue Pocket, targeted at running Undertale v0.8.

## Status

<!--
- What works on a real Pocket today? What have you actually played through yourself?
- Which numbers are worth quoting, and from which benchmark run? The table that was here was out of date.
  Latest measurements (2026-10-08, v0.7 runtime, os25), for reference:
    start-up to first frame 18.9 s
    intro, menu, naming 28.7 ms of work per frame; first room 27.7 ms (the game needs 33.3)
    Flowey's dialogue about 39 ms; battle at native 640x480 about 47 ms
    battle smoothed to 320x240 (L) was 28.3 ms in an earlier run
    Ruins outside Toriel's house about 25 ms
- What is still rough? (Which scenes run below full speed? What happens on a room change now?)
- What is untested? (MiSTer; anything past the opening hours.)
-->

## Building

<!--
- Which host have you built on, and what does it need installed?
- Why are GNU sed and USE_SDK_CONTAINER=0 needed here? (One line each; env.sh has the reasons.)
- What does the reader need to supply, and where does each file go?
- Which commit of the openfpgaOS SDK have you built against? (The port was developed on a408ddc.)
- Where should they look for the rest? (src/openfpga/README.md covers controls, packs, saves,
  the benchmark and diagnostics.)
The commands below match the layout as of 2026-10-08; check they still match how you build.

```bash
git clone -b pocket https://github.com/zenibako/Butterscotch.git butterscotch-pocket
git clone https://github.com/openfpgaOS/openfpgaSDK.git
cd butterscotch-pocket/src/openfpga

# Your own game data: data.win (named game.ios inside the macOS app) and
# the folder holding the game's .ogg files.
cp /path/to/data.win data.win
ln -s /path/to/folder-with-ogg-files music

export PATH="$(brew --prefix gnu-sed)/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"
export USE_SDK_CONTAINER=0
make            # builds the core and its data packs into out/build/pocket/undertale/
make copy       # copies it to a mounted Pocket SD card
```

## Download

<!--
- Is there a build to download yet, and where? Upstream links nightly builds of each platform from
  its CI; the community ports attach a binary to a GitHub release. Neither is set up here yet.
- What can a download contain, given that no game data may be included? (The core, and the two
  tools that build textures.bin and music.bin from the reader's own data.win.)
-->

## Licences and credits

<!--
- Who wrote Butterscotch, and under what licence? What does that licence mean for a core built
  from this repository?
- What does this branch add to Butterscotch? (The software renderer from draft PR #429, this port's
  changes to it, and src/openfpga.)
- What licence is the openfpgaOS SDK under, and does any of it ship in a built core?
- Is there anyone else to credit?
-->

## Disclaimer

<!--
- Butterscotch's own README has a disclaimer about having no association with the software it
  runs and not providing it. Do you want to follow its wording or write your own?
- What must a reader understand about game files before they start?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Butterscotch may have quirks that the original GameMaker: Studio runner may not have!

When you create a game in GameMaker: Studio and export it, GameMaker: Studio exports the game code as bytecode instead of native compiled code, and that bytecode is compatible with any other GameMaker: Studio runner (also known as YoYo runner), as long as they have matching GameMaker: Studio versions. This is similar to how Java applications work.

This is how projects such as [Droidtale](https://mrpowergamerbr.com/projects/droidtale) (which was also made by yours truly) can exist. We exploit that GameMaker: Studio games compile to bytecode, which means they can be ran on *any* platform that has an official runner for it!

Ever since I created Droidtale 10+ years ago, I had that lingering thought in my mind... If GameMaker games use bytecode, what prevents us from creating our *own* runner? And if we can write our *own* runner, what prevents us from porting GameMaker: Studio games to other platforms?

And that's where Butterscotch comes in! Butterscotch is an open source re-implementation of GameMaker: Studio's runner in C.

## Game Compatibility

Butterscotch's goal is to be able to have all bytecode compiled games playable. The majority of GameMaker: Studio games already get in game and some are even playable from start to finish! For a more complete list of working games, check the [Compatibility List.](https://github.com/ButterscotchRunner/CompatibilityList)

Butterscotch supports the following WAD versions:

* WAD Version 8 (GameMaker: Studio 1.0.198+)
* WAD Version 9 (GameMaker: Studio 1.0.527+)
* WAD Version 10 (GameMaker: Studio 1.1.609+)
* WAD Version 11 (GameMaker: Studio 1.1.754+)
* WAD Version 12 (GameMaker: Studio 1.1.867+)
* WAD Version 13 (GameMaker: Studio 1.1.917+)
* WAD Version 14 (GameMaker: Studio 1.4.1464+)
* WAD Version 15 (GameMaker: Studio 1.4.1675+)
* WAD Version 16 (GameMaker: Studio 1.4.1767+)
* WAD Version 17 (GameMaker: Studio 2.2+)

Other modding tools, such as UndertaleModTool, calls it "bytecode version" instead of "WAD version". We decided to go with WAD version instead because there are GameMaker: Studio versions (WAD version 6 and 7) that DO NOT use bytecode altogether, so calling it "bytecode version" is not quite correct, and because that's what the YoYo Runner calls it under the hood.

However, that doesn't mean that a game that uses a compatible version WILL run! The bytecode support is still a WIP, and Butterscotch may have quirks that the original GameMaker: Studio runner may not have.

Of course, some games won't run! Some games aren't VM compiled, such as:

* Games compiled with YYC, because they use native code instead of bytecode. (Ex: Forager, Rivals of Aether)
* Games compiled with the new [GMRT](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GMRT-Beta/tree/main), because they use native code instead of bytecode.
* Games before GameMaker: Studio 1.0.198 (pre-WAD version 8) because they use raw GML code interpreted on load.

## Supported Platforms

* Windows
* macOS
* Web
* PlayStation 2
* PlayStation 3
* PlayStation Vita
* Nintendo Switch
* ...and maybe more in the future!

Butterscotch can be ported to about any console that has the processing power to run it! Butterscotch has already been ported to many consoles such as the Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, and more!

Additionally, any platform with reasonably complete C and POSIX conformance should work, the following have been tested.
* Linux with glibc as old as about ~1995
* FreeBSD as old as 2.2.8
* OpenBSD
* NetBSD
* Haiku
* Solaris/illumos (OpenIndiana tested working)

The following backends are available for desktop platforms (Windows and POSIX systems).
* GLFW 2
* GLFW 3
* SDL 1.2
* SDL 2
* SDL 3
* AppKit (macOS only)

The following compilers have been tested to successfully build Butterscotch, older versions may work but are untested.
* GCC 2.7 and up in C++ mode, and 3.0 and up in C99 mode
* Clang 1.1 and up
* TinyCC 0.9.27 and up
* MSVC 4.0 and up

## Building Butterscotch

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DBACKEND=glfw3 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
make
```

If you are using CLion, set the platform in `Settings` > `Build, Execution, Deployment` > `CMake` and add `-DBACKEND=glfw3`

Then run Butterscotch with `./butterscotch` - it will automatically search for `data.win`, `assets/game.unx`, `assets/game.droid` or `../Resources/game.ios` relative to the binary, otherwise you can specify a path with `./butterscotch /path/to/data.win`.

## CLI parameters

The desktop target has a lot of nifty CLI parameters that you can use to trace and debug games running on it.

## Debug Features

When running Butterscotch with `--debug`, the following hotkeys are enabled:

* `Page Up`: Moves forward one room
* `Page Down`: Moves backwards one room
* `P`: Pauses the game
* `O`: While paused, advances the game loop by one frame
* `F12`: Dumps the current runner state to the console
* `F11`: Dumps the current runner state to the console (JSON format), or dumps it to a file if `--dump-frame-json-file` is set.
* `F10`: Sets the `global.interact` flag to `0`. Useful in Undertale when you are moving through rooms and one of them starts a cutscene that doesn't let you move.

## Performance

Performance is pretty good on any modern computer, but when running on low end targets (like the PS2) it is *very* slow when there's a lot of instances on screen, or when a instance does a for loop.

## Then why not have a transpiler?

The issue with a transpiler is that, if you try transpiling the game in the "naive" way, that is, emitting VM calls like it was the original bytecode, you won't get any
*improvement* from it, you would need to create a *good* transpiler that actually transpiles it into *good* code, and that's way harder.

Having a transpiler also have other disadvantages:

1. You lose the ability of debugging the runner at a "high level" by tracing opcodes.
2. Compilation is SLOW, transpiling Undertale in a naive way to C and building it takes 90 seconds on a modern computer, and building it to other targets is so slow that I wasn't even able to test it.
