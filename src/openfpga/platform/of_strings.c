/*
 * Rewrites the handful of game strings that name keyboard keys so they name
 * the Pocket's buttons instead (see the mapping in of_platform.c).
 *
 * The user's data.win is never modified: the strings are patched in memory
 * after loading. A replacement no longer than the text it replaces is written
 * over the original in the string table, which covers every way the runner
 * reaches a string. A longer one cannot be, so the table's entry is pointed
 * at the new text instead; that reaches code that looks the string up when it
 * runs (all the instruction screen needs), not anything that kept the old
 * pointer from loading.
 *
 * The rows here are the prompts every game might show; a game adds its own
 * in its game_<name>.c, with any change to its code that a prompt needs
 * (Undertale's instruction screen loses a line that way).
