# mkcard.sh — assemble the Pocket SD tree: one Butterscotch core with an
# entry per game. A game is included when its program has been built and
# its data file is there; the entries of the others are left out, so the
# Pocket never lists a game that cannot start.
#
# Each game's program reads "data.win", "textures.bin" and "music.bin" from
# games/<game>/: on the card Deltarune's files carry their own names, and its
# entry (dist/.../Deltarune.json) puts them in the same data slots.

# Usage: mkcard.sh <SDK image.sh> <root holding runtime/ and build/> <dist dir> <port dir>
